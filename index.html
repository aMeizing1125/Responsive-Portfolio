            <p>Hi everyone! My name is Mei please call me Mei. Mei Mei is fine. I am really enjoying this class, but project is killing me.</p>

            <p>Honestly, the last project felt easier. It has been at a crazy fast pace. Me writing this is me procrastinating since I can't seem to get the portfolio section the way I want it.</p>

            <p>I've really enjoyed learning everything but the implementation has a much steeper learning curve. </p>
            
            <p>This is a real picture of my mother. See how she is Asian. And how yeah,... I do kind of look like her. And don't she look good at 58 years old. I know in this picture daaammmnnn!</p>
